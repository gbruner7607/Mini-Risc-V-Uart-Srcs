# Mini Risc-V with UART

This is an FPGA implementation of a RISC-V processor, reprogrammable via serial communication. Instructions and scripts for programming it can be found in my other repository [here](https://github.com/gbruner7607/Mini-Risc-V-gcc) 
<br>
Most all of the work from this comes from Md Badruddoja Majumder, I've merely modified it to be reprogrammable, and expanded the instruction and data memory.
